# Total-COVID-19-Cases-In-India
I joined team Verzeo for internship between May-July 2020. I learnt Machine Learning through the mentors and resources at Verzeo. The major project assigned in this internship required me to build a Linear and Random Forest Regression model which predict the total number of COVID-19 cases in India. I worked on the project and built a Linear and Random Forest Regression model. I also performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the data set given by Verzeo team (Link present in the code). Based on the observations, the project was successfully completed. When you enter a date, the model predicts the total cases of Corona virus in India. This is my first project based on Machine Learning. Glad to share it on GitHub as my contribution to open source.
